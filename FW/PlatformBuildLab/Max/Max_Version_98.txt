1) Create a new folder (directory) on the root of your local hard drive (development
   machine) for use as your work space (this example uses "C:\MyWorkspace").
   Some paths are very long and placing the working directory too deep in the directory 
   structure may cause the path to be longer than Windows maximum path length.

2) Checkout edk2 from GitHub with the following command.
    i)  Run "git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git -b UDK2017"
   ii)  Enter folder edk2
  iii)  Run the command "git checkout vUDK2017"
   iv)  Enter folder "C:\MyWorkspace"

   CryptoPkg Download:

    Follow the instructions found in the file "OpenSSL-HOWTO.txt" located in your
      workspace (e.g. "C:\MyWorkspace\edk2\CryptoPkg\Library\OpensslLib\OpenSSL-HOWTO.txt") 
      to install the Openssl source code.


3) Checkout MinnowBoard Max Branch from GitHub with the following command.
    i)  Run "git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms.git -b devel-MinnowBoardMax-UDK2017"
   ii)  Enter folder edk2-platforms
  iii)  Run the command "git checkout 89b9edaa048fe6d39d53ca2a09d0ea87726f230e"
   iv)  Enter folder "C:\MyWorkspace"
   
4) Checkout BaseTools binaries and copy them to BaseTools binary folder.
    i)  Run "git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-BaseTools-win32.git"
   ii)  Enter folder edk2-BaseTools-win32
  iii)  Run the command "git checkout 0e088c19ab31fccd1d2f55d9e4fe0314b57c0097"       

5) Download MinnowBoard MAX 0.98 Binary Object Modules from http://firmware.intel.com/projects/minnowboard-max.
   The "MinnowBoard_MAX-0.98-Binary.Objects.zip" file contains three additional
   folders required for the full source tree.

	IA32FamilyCpuPkg
	Vlv2BinaryPkg
	Vlv2MiscBinariesPkg

   Create a new directory named "silicon" below WORKSPACE (e.g. "C:\MyWorkspace\silicon").
   Unzip and copy the three folders to the "silicon" directory (e.g. "C:\MyWorkspace\silicon\").

SUMMARY

Directory structure will be as follows after downloading source:
   C:/MyWorkspace
    --- \edk2
	(directories from vUDK2017)
    --- \edk2-platforms
	Vlv2DeviceRefCodePkg
	Vlv2TbltDeviceePkg 	<-------- invoke Build script Here
    --- \edk2-BaseTools-win32
	(Windows Binary Base Tools)
    --- \silicon
	(Step 5. above)
